    """
    Trains a byte-level Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer from a text file.

    This function reads a text file, builds an initial vocabulary from all
    possible byte values (0-255), and iteratively merges the most frequent
    pair of adjacent tokens to build a final vocabulary of the desired size.

    Args:
        input_path (str):
            Path to the training text file. The file will be read as raw bytes.
        vocab_size (int):
            The target vocabulary size. This must be a positive integer >= 256.
            The final vocabulary will contain the initial 256 byte tokens,
            newly merged tokens, and any special tokens, up to this size.
        special_tokens (List[str]):
            A list of special token strings (e.g., ["<|endoftext|>"]) to add
            to the vocabulary. These are added after the BPE merges are
            complete and do not affect the training process itself.

    Returns:
        Tuple[Dict[int, bytes], List[Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]:
            A tuple containing the trained vocabulary and the merge rules:
            - vocab (Dict[int, bytes]): A mapping from token IDs (int) to their
              byte representation (bytes).
            - merges (List[Tuple[bytes, bytes]]): An ordered list of BPE merges.
              Each element is a tuple of two byte strings that were merged,
              in the order the merges were created.
